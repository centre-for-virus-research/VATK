-q/--quality <INT>      Trim low-quality ends from reads in addition to adapter removal. For
                        RRBS samples, quality trimming will be performed first, and adapter
                        trimming is carried in a second round. Other files are quality and adapter
                        trimmed in a single pass. The algorithm is the same as the one used by BWA
                        (Subtract INT from all qualities; compute partial sums from all indices
                        to the end of the sequence; cut sequence at the index at which the sum is
                        minimal). Default Phred score: 20.

--phred33               Instructs Cutadapt to use ASCII+33 quality scores as Phred scores
                        (Sanger/Illumina 1.9+ encoding) for quality trimming. Default: ON.

--phred64               Instructs Cutadapt to use ASCII+64 quality scores as Phred scores
                        (Illumina 1.5 encoding) for quality trimming.

--fastqc                Run FastQC in the default mode on the FastQ file once trimming is complete.

--fastqc_args "<ARGS>"  Passes extra arguments to FastQC. If more than one argument is to be passed
                        to FastQC they must be in the form "arg1 arg2 etc.". An example would be:
                        --fastqc_args "--nogroup --outdir /home/". Passing extra arguments will
                        automatically invoke FastQC, so --fastqc does not have to be specified
                        separately.

-a/--adapter <STRING>   Adapter sequence to be trimmed. If not specified explicitly, Trim Galore will
                        try to auto-detect whether the Illumina universal, Nextera transposase or Illumina
                        small RNA adapter sequence was used. Also see '--illumina', '--nextera' and
                        '--small_rna'. If no adapter can be detected within the first 1 million sequences
                        of the first file specified Trim Galore defaults to '--illumina'.

-a2/--adapter2 <STRING> Optional adapter sequence to be trimmed off read 2 of paired-end files. This
                        option requires '--paired' to be specified as well.

--illumina              Adapter sequence to be trimmed is the first 13bp of the Illumina universal adapter
                        'AGATCGGAAGAGC' instead of the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.

--nextera               Adapter sequence to be trimmed is the first 12bp of the Nextera adapter
                        'CTGTCTCTTATA' instead of the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.

--small_rna             Adapter sequence to be trimmed is the first 12bp of the Illumina Small RNA Adapter
                        'ATGGAATTCTCG' instead of the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.


--stringency <INT>      Overlap with adapter sequence required to trim a sequence. Defaults to a
                        very stringent setting of 1, i.e. even a single bp of overlapping sequence
                        will be trimmed off from the 3' end of any read.

-e <ERROR RATE>         Maximum allowed error rate (no. of errors divided by the length of the matching
                        region) (default: 0.1)

--gzip                  Compress the output file with GZIP. If the input files are GZIP-compressed
                        the output files will automatically be GZIP compressed as well. As of v0.2.8 the
                        compression will take place on the fly.

--dont_gzip             Output files won't be compressed with GZIP. This option overrides --gzip.

--length <INT>          Discard reads that became shorter than length INT because of either
                        quality or adapter trimming. A value of '0' effectively disables
                        this behaviour. Default: 20 bp.

                        For paired-end files, both reads of a read-pair need to be longer than
                        <INT> bp to be printed out to validated paired-end files (see option --paired).
                        If only one read became too short there is the possibility of keeping such
                        unpaired single-end reads (see --retain_unpaired). Default pair-cutoff: 20 bp.

-o/--output_dir <DIR>   If specified all output will be written to this directory instead of the current
                        directory.

--no_report_file        If specified no report file will be generated.

--suppress_warn         If specified any output to STDOUT or STDERR will be suppressed.

--clip_R1 <int>         Instructs Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 5' end of read 1 (or single-end
                        reads). This may be useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there is some
                        sort of unwanted bias at the 5' end. Default: OFF.

--clip_R2 <int>         Instructs Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 5' end of read 2 (paired-end reads
                        only). This may be useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there is some sort
                        of unwanted bias at the 5' end. For paired-end BS-Seq, it is recommended to remove
                        the first few bp because the end-repair reaction may introduce a bias towards low
                        methylation. Please refer to the M-bias plot section in the Bismark User Guide for
                        some examples. Default: OFF.

--three_prime_clip_R1 <int>     Instructs Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 3' end of read 1 (or single-end
                        reads) AFTER adapter/quality trimming has been performed. This may remove some unwanted
                        bias from the 3' end that is not directly related to adapter sequence or basecall quality.
                        Default: OFF.

--three_prime_clip_R2 <int>     Instructs Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 3' end of read 2 AFTER
                        adapter/quality trimming has been performed. This may remove some unwanted bias from
                        the 3' end that is not directly related to adapter sequence or basecall quality.
                        Default: OFF.

--path_to_cutadapt </path/to/cutadapt>     You may use this option to specify a path to the Cutadapt executable,
                        e.g. /my/home/cutadapt-1.7.1/bin/cutadapt. Else it is assumed that Cutadapt is in
                        the PATH.


RRBS-specific options (MspI digested material):

--rrbs                  Specifies that the input file was an MspI digested RRBS sample (recognition
                        site: CCGG). Sequences which were adapter-trimmed will have a further 2 bp
                        removed from their 3' end. This is to avoid that the filled-in C close to the
                        second MspI site in a sequence is used for methylation calls. Sequences which
                        were merely trimmed because of poor quality will not be shortened further.

--non_directional       Selecting this option for non-directional RRBS libraries will screen
                        quality-trimmed sequences for 'CAA' or 'CGA' at the start of the read
                        and, if found, removes the first two basepairs. Like with the option
                        '--rrbs' this avoids using cytosine positions that were filled-in
                        during the end-repair step. '--non_directional' requires '--rrbs' to
                        be specified as well.

--keep                  Keep the quality trimmed intermediate file. Default: off, which means
                        the temporary file is being deleted after adapter trimming. Only has
                        an effect for RRBS samples since other FastQ files are not trimmed
                        for poor qualities separately.


Note for RRBS using MseI:

If your DNA material was digested with MseI (recognition motif: TTAA) instead of MspI it is NOT necessary
to specify --rrbs or --non_directional since virtually all reads should start with the sequence
'TAA', and this holds true for both directional and non-directional libraries. As the end-repair of 'TAA'
restricted sites does not involve any cytosines it does not need to be treated especially. Instead, simply
run Trim Galore! in the standard (i.e. non-RRBS) mode.


Paired-end specific options:

--paired                This option performs length trimming of quality/adapter/RRBS trimmed reads for
                        paired-end files. To pass the validation test, both sequences of a sequence pair
                        are required to have a certain minimum length which is governed by the option
                        --length (see above). If only one read passes this length threshold the
                        other read can be rescued (see option --retain_unpaired). Using this option lets
                        you discard too short read pairs without disturbing the sequence-by-sequence order
                        of FastQ files which is required by many aligners.

                        Trim Galore! expects paired-end files to be supplied in a pairwise fashion, e.g.
                        file1_1.fq file1_2.fq SRR2_1.fq.gz SRR2_2.fq.gz ... .

-t/--trim1              Trims 1 bp off every read from its 3' end. This may be needed for FastQ files that
                        are to be aligned as paired-end data with Bowtie. This is because Bowtie (1) regards
                        alignments like this:

                          R1 --------------------------->     or this:    ----------------------->  R1
                          R2 <---------------------------                       <-----------------  R2

                        as invalid (whenever a start/end coordinate is contained within the other read).

--retain_unpaired       If only one of the two paired-end reads became too short, the longer
                        read will be written to either '.unpaired_1.fq' or '.unpaired_2.fq'
                        output files. The length cutoff for unpaired single-end reads is
                        governed by the parameters -r1/--length_1 and -r2/--length_2. Default: OFF.

-r1/--length_1 <INT>    Unpaired single-end read length cutoff needed for read 1 to be written to
                        '.unpaired_1.fq' output file. These reads may be mapped in single-end mode.
                        Default: 35 bp.

-r2/--length_2 <INT>    Unpaired single-end read length cutoff needed for read 2 to be written to
                        '.unpaired_2.fq' output file. These reads may be mapped in single-end mode.
                        Default: 35 bp.
