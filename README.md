Virus Analysis Tool Kit


1. Evaluating your raw sequencing data
        1. counting sequences: fastq and fastq.gz
        2. quality assurance: FASTQC and samstats
        3. Determining the quality and complexity of next-generation sequencing data without a reference genome 
2. trimming and de-multiplexing: Trimmomatic, Fastx_toolkit, fastx_trimmer, cutadapt, trim_galore, condetri, flexor (https://github.com/seqan/flexbar)
3. genotype detection, reference selection (Sreenuâ€™s tool), (de-novo assembly??)
4. alignment: bowtie2, bwa, tanoti
5. post alignment stats: wee_sam, count duplicates from SAM (Sreenu for Andrew)
6. post alignment analysis: haplotype window, remove primer reads, detecting chimeras???
7. consensus calling 
8. variant calling (link to ValVs)
