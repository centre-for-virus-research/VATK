# VATK
Virus Analysis Tool Kit


Evaluating your raw sequencing data
        counting sequences: fastq and fastq.gz
        quality assurance: FASTQC and samstats
        Determining the quality and complexity of next-generation sequencing data without a reference genome 
trimming and de-multiplexing: Trimmomatic, Fastx_toolkit, fastx_trimmer, cutadapt, trim_galore, condetri, flexor (https://github.com/seqan/flexbar)
genotype detection, reference selection (Sreenuâ€™s tool), (de-novo assembly??)
alignment: bowtie2, bwa, tanoti
post alignment stats: wee_sam, count duplicates from SAM (Sreenu for Andrew)
post alignment analysis: haplotype window, remove primer reads, detecting chimeras???
